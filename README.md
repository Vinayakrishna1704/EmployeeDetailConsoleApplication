# 🧮 Employee Management Console Application (C# & LINQ, .NET 8)

##  Overview
This project is a **C# console application** built using **.NET 8**, designed to demonstrate the use of **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)** for data manipulation and analysis.  
It simulates an **Employee Management System**, allowing users to interact with employee data through a simple menu-driven interface.

The primary objective of this project is to **showcase how LINQ queries simplify data filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation** in real-world scenarios.

##  Features
The application provides a menu with the following options:

| Option | Description |
|:------:|:-------------|
| 0 | **Display All Employee Data** – Shows the full list of employees with details such as ID, Name, Department, Age, and Salary. |
| 1 | **Search Employee by Name** – Finds employees whose names match or contain the search keyword (case-insensitive). |
| 2 | **Filter by Department** – Displays employees belonging to a specific department. |
| 3 | **Sort by Salary** – Sorts and displays employees in descending order of salary. |
| 4 | **Group by Department** – Groups employees by their department and displays the grouped data. |
| 5 | **Top 3 Highest Paid Employees** – Displays the three employees with the highest salaries. |
| 6 | **Check Employee Existence** – Verifies whether an employee exists by name. |
| 7 | **Department Statistics** – Calculates and displays the average salary for each department. |

All these operations are implemented using **LINQ queries**, showcasing both **query syntax** and **method syntax**.
